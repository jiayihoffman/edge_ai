# Robot Car

I have two lovely cats. I often miss them when I am traveling. I have a cat sitter come help, but I think having a robot that I can remotely drive, and see what the robot sees will be great. Then I can see what my cats are doing and talk to them whenever I want.   

Technologies used here are Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Kafka event streaming. Arduino is for IO, Raspberry Pi is the controller, which responds to commands I sent remotely. The Pi also uploads the video stream while it drives through the house. 

WIP... Please check back later for more detail.
