# Robot Car

A robot car that I can remotely drive to check up on my pets and patrol the house while I am away. I see everything through the robot's camera. The robot uses Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and WebRTC for P2P real-time video, audio, and bidirectional data exchange.

Arduino is for IO and has more capability than the Raspberry Pi; the Pi is a controller, the robotâ€™s brain. The Pi sends me the live video stream through WebRTC while driving through the house, and it responds to commands I send remotely through the WebRTC data channel.
