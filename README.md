## Smart robots make home safe and fun.

[Security Camera](./security_camera/README.md) is a image classify project running on Raspberry Pi using Pi camera streaming. The model is fine tuned using my own images, and quantized to reduce its size and speed to fit on a Raspberry Pi. 

[Robot Car](./robot_car/README.md) is another project that allows me to remotely drive the car and see the house while I am away.
